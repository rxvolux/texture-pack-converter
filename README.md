# Texture Pack Converter
A GitHub Repository on how to convert your favourite Minecraft Texture Packs to Bloxd!

## Get Started
If you are unaware as to how to upload your own texture pack, I reccomend you check out the [Bloxd Texture Pack Setup](https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs/blob/main/README.md) to first get started with Texture Packs. This will teach you how to upload your own texture pack and the formats of a Bloxd Texture Pack.

## Requirements
Now, if you're curious as to how you can convert your own Minecraft texture pack, you need to know the requirements. When setting it up, just note:
* We do **not** support Bedrock Texture Packs at the moment.
* We do **not** support Optifine Texture Packs at the moment.
* Please do **not** upload your texture pack as a `.zip` file as it will not work!

Now you know what not to do, you can now look at how to setup your very own texture pack.

## Setup
1. Head over to the [Converter Site](https://bloxdmarkets.gg/converter)
2. Find a Java Texture Pack you love, a popular site is [resourcepacks.gg](https://resourcepack.gg)
3. Download the texture pack, it should appear as a `.zip`. Expand the file by double clicking, and it should become a folder.
4. Once you have the folder, head over back to the site and upload it.
5. Wait till its finished converting and go ahead to download. You then should be able to use that Texture Pack within Bloxd.io
